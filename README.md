#New Portifolio

Tired with my old portfolio I decided to make a new one with the languages I currently work with, which are Angular and Bootstrap for styling.
It's a basic portfolio, without a lot of fancy couplings, but it's something that's 100% made by me. Finally I want you to like it and if you want to copy it I'm happy and if you have any questions you can call me
